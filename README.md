# Call Search Tool - Tkinter  
This project was developed to overcome the limitations imposed by my company's development area for creating an application. It serves as a local graphical interface for searching "random" calls, utilizing the **Tkinter** library to provide a lightweight and user-friendly solution that can be deployed across all sites where it is needed.  

The application is shared as open source and has no license restrictions. I aim to make it accessible to others who might find this tool useful or are working on similar projects.
